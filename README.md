# Enhanced Voting App with Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD

This repository showcases an example of a distributed voting application running across multiple Docker containers, orchestrated with Kubernetes, and automated with a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline. It's a practical demonstration of using containerization and orchestration technologies for a microservices architecture in a cloud environment like AWS.

## Overview

The application is a simple voting platform where users can cast votes. It consists of several microservices written in different languages (Python, Node.js, .NET), demonstrating a polyglot architecture. It uses Redis for messaging and Postgres for storage. 

## Key Features (including Secure Configuration Management)

- **Containerized Microservices:** Each component of the application runs in its own Docker container.
- **Kubernetes Orchestration:** The app is deployed on a Kubernetes cluster, showcasing pod management, service discovery, and scalability.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated build and deployment using Jenkins, including pushing Docker images to Docker Hub and deploying to Kubernetes.
- **Cloud-Native Integration:** Deployed on an EKS cluster with considerations for cloud-specific features like EBS CSI driver.
- **Kubernetes Secrets:** This project leverages Kubernetes Secrets to securely manage sensitive configurations. The PostgreSQL database credentials are stored as secrets, ensuring secure access and management. This approach exemplifies best practices in secure configuration management in a Kubernetes environment.
- **Persistent Storage with PVC and PV:** The application leverages Kubernetes PersistentVolumes (PVs) and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) for efficient and reliable data storage. This ensures data persistence for stateful components like the Postgres database, allowing for data retention across pod restarts and deployments.
- **Load Balancing:** Utilizes Kubernetes LoadBalancer services to manage incoming traffic.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) for container management.- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) for interacting with your Kubernetes cluster.
- Access to a Kubernetes cluster, such as [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) for local testing or [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) for cloud deployment.

### Running the App with Docker Compose

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run the following command:
```shell
   docker compose up
```

The `vote` app will be running at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000), and the `results` will be at [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001).

Alternately, if you want to run it on a [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/), first make sure you have a swarm. If you don't, run:

```shell
docker swarm init
```

Once you have your swarm, in this directory run:

```shell
docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-stack.yml vote
```
## Running the App in Kubernetes

The `k8s` folder contains the YAML specifications of the Voting App's services, including LoadBalancer configurations for easy access.

### Deployment Instructions

1. Deploy the application to your Kubernetes cluster:
```shell
   kubectl apply -f k8s/
```
This will create the necessary deployments and services in your current namespace (default if not specified).

2. Once the services are deployed, Kubernetes will provision LoadBalancer endpoints for the 'vote' and 'result' web apps. You can find these endpoints by running:
```shell
kubectl get svc
```
Look for the external IP addresses or hostnames provided for the 'vote' and 'result' services. The 'vote web' app will be accessible at the LoadBalancer endpoint provided by Kubernetes (port 80 by default). The 'result' web app can be accessed similarly at its own LoadBalancer endpoint (also port 80).

##  Cleaning Up

To remove the deployed resources from your cluster, run:
```shell
kubectl delete -f k8s/
```
## Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline

This project incorporates a robust Jenkins pipeline for continuous integration and deployment, automating the lifecycle of application development from code changes to deployment in Kubernetes.

### Pipeline Stages

- **Checkout:** Clones the latest code from the main branch of the GitHub repository.
- **Build Docker Images:** Builds Docker images for the `vote`, `result`, and `worker` components of the application.
- **Login to Docker Hub:** Authenticates with Docker Hub to enable pushing images.
- **Push Image to Docker Hub:** Pushes the newly built images to Docker Hub.
- **Check/Create Kubernetes Namespace:** Checks if the specified Kubernetes namespace exists and creates it if it doesn't.
- **Deploy to Kubernetes:** Deploys the application to Kubernetes using manifests in the `k8s` directory.
- **Post-build Cleanup:** Removes the built Docker images from the Jenkins agent to free up space.

### Key Features of the Pipeline

- **Automated Image Builds:** Ensures that the latest version of the application is containerized.
- **Docker Hub Integration:** Seamlessly pushes images to Docker Hub, ready for deployment.
- **Dynamic Namespace Management:** Intelligently handles Kubernetes namespaces, creating them as needed.
- **Kubernetes Deployment:** Automates the deployment process to Kubernetes, making the latest version of the app always available.
- **Resource Cleanup:** Maintains a clean build environment by removing unused Docker images after the build process.

### Prerequisites for Jenkins

- Jenkins server with Docker and Kubernetes plugins installed.
- Proper credentials configured in Jenkins for Docker Hub and Kubernetes cluster access.

### Pipeline Execution

- The pipeline is triggered by any change in the `main` branch of the GitHub repository (GitHub Webhook) or manually via the Jenkins interface.
- Each stage is clearly logged for easy tracking and troubleshooting.
- The pipeline's progress and results can be monitored in the Jenkins dashboard.

By integrating this Jenkins pipeline, the project demonstrates a practical application of CI/CD principles, ensuring that updates and new features are smoothly and reliably rolled out. This CI/CD setup ensures that the application is automatically updated in the Kubernetes cluster with each code change, making the development process more efficient and reliable.

## Architecture

![Architecture diagram](architecture.excalidraw.png)

* A front-end web app in [Python](/vote) which lets you vote between two options
* A [Redis](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/) which collects new votes
* A [.NET](/worker/) worker which consumes votes and stores them inâ€¦
* A [Postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) database backed by a Docker volume
* A [Node.js](/result) web app which shows the results of the voting in real time

## Notes

The voting application only accepts one vote per client browser. It does not register additional votes if a vote has already been submitted from a client.
